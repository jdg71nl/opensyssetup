Viewing photo GPS locations on linux

Posted by James Birkett on 5 September 2024 in English.

I’m running linux as my desktop OS and couldn’t find a tool I was happy with for viewing the GPS coordinates stored in a photograph’s metadata (exif). I whipped up this quick-and-dirty shell script to do it for me.

~/.local/bin/photolocation :

xdg-open $(seq 1 4 | while read i; do exif "$1" -m --ifd=GPS -t=0x000$i; done  | tr '\n' ' ' | awk  '{printf ("%s%.6f %s%.6f\n",$1,$2+$3/60+$4/3600,$5,$6+$7/60+$8/3600)}' |sed 's/[NE]//;s/[SW]/-/;' | awk '{printf "https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=" $1 "&mlon=" $2 "#map=18/" $1 "/" $2 "\n"}')

I also made a .desktop entry so I can run it from the file manager or from my image viewer by choosing “open with…”

.local/share/applications/photolocation.desktop :

[Desktop Entry]
Name=View location in OpenStreetMap
TryExec=photolocation
Exec=photolocation %f
Terminal=false
Type=Application
MimeType=image/jpeg;image/jpg;
Keywords=Picture;Photo;Photograph;Map;OpenStreetMap;
