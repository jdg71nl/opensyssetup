d030413 had problems with booting redhat.
After boot kernel, and init, check / fs, usually:
 remount / with read-write
This gave error -> it stayed read-only, then boot up failed.

Problem:
 mount uses 'label' of ext2/ext3 filesystem.
Resolution:
 Make sure only on filesystem has label '/'
 Use tool: e2label /dev/hda6 otherlabel
