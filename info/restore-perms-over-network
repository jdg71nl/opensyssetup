I have made a litte error:
the command '/root> chmod -R ug-rwx .*' destroyed many perms also in the root '/' and beyond...
This is how I repaired it:


On one PC with correct permissions: print perms and filename, then send over network:
> find . -printf "%m %p\n" | nc -n 2.10.40.253 3434

On other PC with files/dirs to be corrected: receive strings and foreach line: chmod
> nc -l -p 3434 | perl -ne 'chdir "/";while(<>){$x=$_;qx"chmod $x";print $x;}'
