# resulting file: Image Resize AppleScript.app

Open Script Editor, and create the following new script:

-- save in Script Editor as Application
-- drag files to its icon in Finder

on open some_items
  repeat with this_item in some_items
    try
      rescale_and_save(this_item)
    end try
  end repeat
end open


to rescale_and_save(this_item)
  tell application "Image Events"
    launch
    set the target_width to 120
    -- open the image file
    set this_image to open this_item
    
    set typ to this_image's file type
    
    copy dimensions of this_image to {current_width, current_height}
    if current_width is greater than current_height then
      scale this_image to size target_width
    else
      -- figure out new height
      -- y2 = (y1 * x2) / x1
      set the new_height to (current_height * target_width) / current_width
      scale this_image to size new_height
    end if
    
    tell application "Finder" to set new_item to Â¬
    (container of this_item as string) & "scaled." & (name of this_item)
    save this_image in new_item as typ
    
  end tell
end rescale_and_save

Save this as an application, and then place its icon somewhere easy to reach (dock, desktop, whatever). Drag and drop an image, or a number of images, onto the icon, and a few moments later, you'll have a file named scaled.Original_File_Name sitting in the same folder as the source image(s). It doesn't get much easier than that!

You can, of course, pick another width other than 120 pixels (just change the noted line in the source). With a bit more work, you could have this script prompt for the width, or set the scale based on height targets, etc. Thanks to Sal and Doug for this very useful script; I'll actually use it a fair bit when I just have a simple resize need!
